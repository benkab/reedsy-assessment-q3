                    In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment,
                    Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic
                    and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the
                    United States of America—the first African American
                    to serve in that role—she helped create the most
                    welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while
                    also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for
                    women and girls in the U.S. and around the world,
                    dramatically changing the ways that families pursue
                    healthier and more active lives, and standing with
                    her husband as he led America through some of its
                    most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us
                    a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised
                    two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media
                    glare.

                    In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing
                    storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world,
                    chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her
                    childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an
                    executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to
                    her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With
                    unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs
                    and her disappointments, both public and private, telling
                    her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on
                    her own terms.

                            For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley
                            Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late
                            1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals
                            immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But
                            Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has
                            survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home,
                            finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then
                            the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When
                            two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty,
                            Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens.

                            Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was
                            seventeen the first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family
                            was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to
                            ensure the children received an education, and no one to intervene
                            when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another
                            brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind
                            of life. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over
                            oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University.
                            Only then would she wonder if she’d traveled too far, if there was
                            still a way home.
