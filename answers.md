1. About you

One of my biggest achievements is 'student.net', It's a project built with Laravel for Backend, Vue js and Progressive Web App for Front End and a mobile application built with React Native (to be deployed soon).
The project is a learning web application, allowing students from universities in the democratic republic of the Congo to buy and permanently read courses content with and without internet connection.
The project fits well with countries of this side of the globe where the access of the internet still a luxury.

2. General

  2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

    I prefer to receive design templates and convert them to beautiful websites/web applications. It is always nice to work with APIs from a remote backend

  2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?

    I often make use header, footer and section. I use them almost all of the time, they help a lot since they are meaningful from how they are named

  2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting innerHTML and using createElement

    InnerHTML is known as faster and easier to work with. But, it forces you to relocate the created nodes if you need to refer to them again.
    While createElement creates the HTML element. The element specified using elementName is created or an unknown HTML element is created if the specified elementName is not recognized.

  2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow

    Two-way data binding means basically 2 things: when properties in the model get updated, so does the UI. and when UI elements get updated, the changes get propagated back to the model.
    One-way data flow just means that the model is the single source of truth.

  2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?

    I was the concept a lot with React.JS, when making Http request or when waiting from props values, it helps to wait for values while being loaded.
